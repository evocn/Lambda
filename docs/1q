## Adjudications

## Session 7 - A Night of Dreams.
The Shadow Guild - They won't train her, since she doesn't have a good reason to do what she says she wants to do.
* She needs a reason besides proving herself. They've had plenty of thieves who want to prove themselves, but the shadow guild only accepts thieves who believe in something.
* Lem, the Brain, lost his land to nobility, and so he sticks up for commoners.
* Jain, the Brawn, hurt his wife in a drunken rage long ago, and wants to save women from the wroth of men.
* Ivory, the Fingers, lost a hand while acquiring ill-gotten gains, and he wants to earn money the right way this time, while using his talents. His dream is home ownership in the countryside.
* Kevan, the Blade, the last leader, had infiltrated the House of Errol to root out corruption. He was once a lord, but lost his power to corruption.

She returns to the inn, defeated, and a little bit lost. She dreams of home, unbidden, and of a destiny she cannot decide upon.

Asha dreams of Rain, and of the Citadel of the Sun. Of the old empire.
* She imagines herself among her people.

Sha'virr's horse comes outside the inn in the dead of night. Its eyes glow blue, and it can communicate with Eugenia.
* They have a normal conversation. Sha'virr apologizes for his short notice disappearance, and informs her that he has sensed her scrying.
* He says he is sorry he cannot be there with her, but that he is glad to see she still has courage to go on.
* He tells her that he had visited Errol to investigate the situation, and now heads to the Desert to restrain the shades.
* He asks if she has found any information on the darkness. He is shocked when she tells him of the Keystone. "Of course! Neral, that old fool, he must be right."
* He determines that if it is the crown, then they must start looking across the Four Kingdoms for where it remains.
* "I've been tracing powerful magic sources for many years. I have a few sources of power here, which may lead us to the crown."
* The nearest place being the Ruins of Old Emory.
* He has an important place he needs her to investigate, the Keep at Helios, which was an old Myelar fortress.
* His strongest scrying can detect some remnant of the Crown of Light there.
* Sha'virr warns Eugenia that the situation is dire, and that she must stay strong...

Lance dreams of a girl, from his past life. A memory, playing over and over, of
the last night they spent drinking here in Emory. Of a fond farewell, her off
to Umber, him to the Sands. Of her confident smile.

Lazarus dreams of Eugenia morphing into a sorceress.

*The Dungeon at Old Emory*
* Why is it here?
* What is in the dungeon?

They go to the ruins, not an hour's ride away from the new city.
It's just the foundations of old buildings, and silt has filled most of the basements.
The place has been picked clean. Any looters have had fifty years to take what they please.
The place they're looking for is under the old keep, in the middle. It's buried under a 6-foot pile of sediment, so they'll need shovels, but they should be able to clear it out in like an hour.

Once they uncover the basement, they can head on down.

1. Stairs into a caved in hall. Crawl through a tiny crack!
2. Enter Hallway which is in near-pristine condition.
* Asha starts getting bad feeling. Evil presence. She can track it down.
* Old banners of Errol on the walls.
3. Mess Hall, cleared out. No food or anything, just empty rooms.
4. A single out-of-place thing in the study. One bookshelf has fallen over, and blocks the door. But the shelves and the desk contain nothing. Only spiderwebs.
* This is the first time this place has seen light in fifty years.
5. A Mole Hole in the ceiling of the stone passageway.
6. A sealed door. "Here lie the dead of Emory - lost during the siege of the Ninth Century. May they rest forever in peace". The Crypt.
* A noise within. A clicking. Some terrible feeling for Asha. The treasure is in there.

The door is a great, heavy stone door, but it gives a millimeter with the help of many and leverage.

7. The Crypt is a place of rot. Many, many bodies lie atop shelves in the walls.
* Not a sound, once they're within. They investigate everything, and they see one of the dead has a precious ring on their person. Question of whether they disturb the dead to get it.
* A clicking sound in the corner of the room.
* A tiny sliver of a hole seems to open into

## Journeys to Undertake
Alice |
Who is she? What does she want?
Give her a bone with the Shadow Guild. See what she decides.

Lazarus |
... have to show their past, and have a clear and defined struggle for them to overcome.
What would be cool is if Eugenia started to foster dark power, due to her proficiency.
Then Lazarus has to decide whether to trust her or to try and stop her.

Lance |
Sees the world. Does something important with his wisdom.
Would be cool if he became a knight.

Asha | 
Her goal is to live on for the sake of the Myelar, but that is a hard thing to challenge.
My idea is that she must become a leader, and must sacrifice herself and the last of the Myelar to stop evil.
I think it would be cool if most of her people were against helping, and she had to inspire them to do it.
Just a thought.

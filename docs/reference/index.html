	<p>OUT OF DATE!!! Read with caution&hellip;</p>
<h1 id="alice">Alice</h1>
<p>The second in line to the baking dynasty of the Brown family.</p>
<p>An overconfident child, with no talents useful to her.</p>
<p>She spends her restless days slinking around town, getting into trouble, and hating her sister Andy and family.</p>
<p>Motivation: To prove herself.</p>
<h1 id="lance">Lance</h1>
<p>An old hermit from the black hills.</p>
<p>In another life, he was a merchant. His business partner cheated him out of his riches.
Ever since, bitter and afraid, Lance has hidden in the woods, and he has grown old.</p>
<p>Lance is a very polite man, even after his years of isolation. He is courteous and noble, like the old ways.</p>
<p>Motivation: Rediscover myself.</p>
<h1 id="asha">Asha</h1>
<p>A Myelar Elf, born in the great turning period of a thousand years ago, but only awoken in the last hundred.</p>
<p>Immune to the moon-sickness. Alone.</p>
<p>Asha is quiet, but curious. She does not really know herself, or how to know any other.</p>
<p>Motivation: Find peace.
To live on for her people&rsquo;s sake.</p>
<h1 id="eugenia">Eugenia</h1>
<p>A middle-aged loner from the village of Khmer. She is a five-foot tall woman with grimy features and a tendency to strong emotion.</p>
<p>She spent her youth pining after a love which was not reciprocated.
During her self-imposed exile, she encountered a warlock, <em><strong>Sha&rsquo;virr</strong></em>, who took her in and supported her.
Alice of the village found her and began bringing her bread, and Sha&rsquo;virr began showing her the mysteries of magic.
To his surprise, Eugenia, a pitiful creature by this point, showed great promise in the arcane.
For four years she has been his pupil, and has learned much, though is still ignorant of the world and her own dreams.</p>
<p>Motivation: Become someone lovable.</p>
<h1 id="lazarus">Lazarus</h1>
<p>A traveler of the precipice.</p>
<p>Originally from the deserts of the west, he spends his days wandering, bare of foot, between the desert and the verdane.
He peddles his specialty wares - salted lizards - and enjoys whatever company he finds on the road.</p>
<p>To what end he searches, he will not tend to say.
But deep in his heart, he sees his journey with a single, clear destination: to find the right place to die.
He has not found it yet.</p>
<p>Lazarus believes in courage above all else. He will suffer no fools or cowards. He speaks his mind.</p>
<p>Motivation: Find good death.</p>

<h1 id="items-and-legends">Items and Legends</h1>
<h1 id="the-keystone">The Keystone</h1>
<p>The old Kings of Myelar wore crowns made by the gods.
The Crowns of Light.</p>
<p>It is said that the old kings of Myelar brought enemies to their cause. They were invincible.
In times of darkness, the kings provided for all their subjects, and kept the darkness at bay.</p>
<h1 id="goblins">Goblins</h1>
<p>Creatures of the Earth. They gave trouble to the Myelar in the days of sunlight.</p>
<h1 id="the-four-kingdoms">The Four Kingdoms</h1>
<h1 id="errol">Errol</h1>
<h1 id="the-precipice">The Precipice</h1>
<h1 id="khmer">Khmer</h1>
<p>A village of 150 people. Farmers.</p>
<h2 id="walter-the-blacksmith">Walter, the Blacksmith</h2>
<p>Walter Donavan is a middle-aged Lankhmari man with an old black cat and a hearty laugh.</p>
<p>He crafts horseshoes and plowshares for the local farmers, and hasn&rsquo;t touched a blade since he left his home kingdom.</p>
<p>He hails originally from the hold of Earthblade, where he was born and raised in peace-time, a smith since a boy.</p>
<p>Walter&rsquo;s stock is as follows:
Axe - 3 Gold
Sickle - 1 Gold
Smith&rsquo;s Tools - 3 Gold</p>
<p>For a custom request, he&rsquo;ll charge according to standard rates, with a 10% service charge.
He&rsquo;ll also hone or repair broken weapons and tools, for 1/4 the price of the item.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;ll charge a 1 Gold service fee for custom weapons and tools.</p>
<p>Walter keeps an apprentice, and spends the idle days teaching him. He&rsquo;s getting quite good, and Walter does little work these days.</p>
<h2 id="averron-the-trader">Averron, the Trader</h2>
<p>Averron Hyde is a quiet, frail man, with an honest look in his eye.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s lived a long life, and seen many of the cities of the West, though he has been retired here for as long as any can remember.</p>
<p>He tallies the taxes for the House of Errol here, and yet is still beloved by all - a feat!</p>
<p>Averron&rsquo;s stock consists of:</p>
<ul>
<li>12 Torches</li>
<li>30 Day&rsquo;s sundries</li>
<li>4 Shovels</li>
<li>2 Sickles</li>
<li>1 Dull Axe, for half price.</li>
<li>2 Knives</li>
<li>A knight&rsquo;s helm, embroidered with fineries. Underpriced at 7 Gold. He&rsquo;s had the thing for many years.</li>
<li>A padded tunic, good for light armor of 1 AC. He charges 7 Gold for the piece.</li>
<li>A worn and battered cart, selling for a mere 4 Gold. Buyer will have to provide maintenence on a broken wheel.</li>
<li>2 Mules, for 10 Gold a piece.</li>
<li>A single mare, a draft horse - old and strong. 25 Gold.</li>
</ul>
<p>Averron has a wife, <em><strong>Leanna</strong></em>, a scrawny woman with exquisite tastes,
and a child, Ellis, born from Leanna late in life. He&rsquo;s thirteen.</p>
<h2 id="helen-the-tavern-keep">Helen, the Tavern Keep</h2>
<p>Tales are told of how Helen&rsquo;s husband died, and how she earned the honor of keeping the old road house,
but they are in hushed whispers, and kept far from Helen&rsquo;s bar.</p>
<p>She seats a dozen each night, with up to three times as many on weekends, and sleeps two in the unfurnished rooms below the house.
Helen tolerates no nonsense, dislikes rowdiness, and especially strangers - perhaps she&rsquo;s been burned too many times before.</p>
<p>But that hardness of heart is perhaps the only reason why Khmer can purchase wine
in such quantity and quality from Emory, and for that, the townsfolk look past
her unfriendly exterior.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;ll charge a Silver piece for a mug of ale and a decent meal, and a silver for two more mugs of ale after the first.</p>
<p>She permits a few cracks of life in this place, but otherwise she&rsquo;s a hard woman.</p>
<p><em><strong>Old John</strong></em> spends his days here, asleep in a rocking chair, and for an hour each night, he&rsquo;ll play the harmonica for you.
Helen lets him stay, free of charge. He&rsquo;s got no family to speak of, and his stories never quite add up.</p>
<p><em><strong>Wendy</strong></em> is a serving girl from a poor farmer&rsquo;s house. She sleeps upstairs.
She&rsquo;s never once allowed herself an aspiration, though perhaps could use for a bit of confidence -
she&rsquo;s almost to shy to take orders from customers.</p>
<p>A few other regulars come here nightly, including Walter and Averron, who are good friends.
Others include&hellip;</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Reagan</strong></em>, a boy enamoured with Wendy,</li>
<li><em><strong>Quill</strong></em>, who is well-known as a cutpurse from Emory - hiding in plain sight, with a bribe to Helen to keep his place here from some unknowable stash of loot,
He is in fact a member of the Shadow Guild, an order of honorable thieves across the Four.</li>
<li><em><strong>Tyrosh</strong></em>, called such by his home city from the desert, who farms the green lands as good as any from Errol, but carries a bejeweled saber at his side at all functions,</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="captain-warren-of-the-errol-guard">Captain Warren, of the Errol Guard</h2>
<p>While at times Captain Warren will drink with his men and make merry, he takes his responsibility in Khmer very seriously.
He loves his men and the people of this town, and he does not make decisions lightly.</p>
<p>Once a promising tactician, meant for the knighthood. Assigned to Emory, and then to Khmer, due to disagreements with management.</p>
<p>Warren is a good-hearted man, but is not negotiated with, and does not believe in trading lives. He will avoid bloodshed at all cost.</p>
<p>His defense of the village of Khmer is an iron one, and the townsfolk are grateful for it, especially in light of recent threatening events.</p>
<p>The other men who fill out the four rooms of the Khmer Guardhouse are either locals or the less savory of their brothers in oath at the bigger cities.
Notable is</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Oaf</strong></em>, the deputy, who lives up to his name, and</li>
<li><em><strong>Pascal</strong></em>, an honorable servant of the House of Errol. Seeks the good of the people here.</li>
<li>Otherwise, there&rsquo;s <em><strong>Ron</strong></em>, and <em><strong>Little John</strong></em>, a pair of local delinquents turned guards.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="amos-and-avery-baker-hereditary-bakers-of-the-west-of-errol">Amos and Avery Baker, Hereditary bakers of the West of Errol.</h2>
<p>The single most famous people in the village of Errol, and perhaps in Emory as well.</p>
<p>Their bread is the primary food of the people of the village, and the primary export of Errol.</p>
<p>Though their bread&rsquo;s quality is perhaps better explained by the freshness of the grain, by the nearness of its processing to its growing,
their craft is indeed a magic of its own.</p>
<p>They have ten children.
There are four girls besides Alice: Allie, Aggie, Annie,
There are five boys, all named after famous Bakers: Alm, Amos Jr., Alexander, Atman, and young Andrew.
They also take care of their grandmother, Augustina.</p>
<p><em><strong>Andy</strong></em> will inherit the bakery, and has already her mother&rsquo;s talents. Alice&hellip; not so much.
Andy is married to <em><strong>Maurice</strong></em>, a farmer who will take over the baker&rsquo;s trade soon.</p>
<h2 id="shavirr-warlock-of-the-wastes">Sha&rsquo;virr, Warlock of the Wastes.</h2>
<p>Sha&rsquo;virr is an old master of druid craft from the distant sands.</p>
<p>He lives near Khmer in a hollow tree stump. He works at strange potions and scrolls.
His apprentice is the hero Eugenia. He calls her by the Nafud term &ldquo;Maia&rdquo;, meaning &ldquo;Feminine one&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Soon after Eugenia leaves, he disappears, leaving only a note.
His mission is to investigate the magical imbalances in Umber, and elsewhere in the world.</p>
<h1 id="blackstone-keep">Blackstone Keep</h1>
<p>Long ago, Blackstone Keep was a Wizard&rsquo;s hold called the <em><strong>Amber Keep</strong></em>.
Now, it molds, and is home not to a master of magicks, but to a band known as the <em><strong>Blackbirds</strong></em>.</p>
<h1 id="fort-moonlight">Fort Moonlight</h1>
<p>An ancient castle of the Myelar.</p>
<p>Only two towers remain, half destroyed. All else is rubble.</p>
<h2 id="rain">Rain</h2>
<p>A mysterious Myelar.
Old and thin.
His knowledge is vast, as are his opinions.
He has seen many, many years.
The comings and goings of men. The risings and fallings of kingdoms. Now he is alone.
His powers wane in his old age, and he speaks dearly of swimming out to sea someday soon, but he has work yet to do.
The Spirit drew him here, and bade him guide the young Asha.</p>
<h1 id="emory">Emory</h1>
<p>A city, the biggest in the west. 3000 men live here, and their wives and children make near 10000.
Known for harvest, trade, and craft.
Well out of Errol, and thus a hub for outriding and smuggling, though small-time in nature.</p>
<p>Emory is a walled city, though they are short and thin walls, of wood. Like Jamestown.
Around the walls is a deep moat, carved long ago and filled regularly. It is squalid and thick-smelling.
There is a main drag, with a square and market stalls. There are homes along the edges, stacked well atop eachother.
Emory was rebuilt within recent memory, and old Emory stands to the south by a half dozen leagues, a ruin of a burning long ago.</p>
<p>The city&rsquo;s population is about a fifth Nafud folk, but mostly ancestral Errol folk.
They are mostly uneducated, peasants.</p>
<h2 id="captain-moss-of-the-kings-guard">Captain Moss, of the King&rsquo;s Guard</h2>
<p>Captain Moss commands over 200 men in Emory, and near 400 in Western Errol, including the towns and the Farwatch.</p>
<p>He is a stern man. Humorless.
Sworn to the House of Errol.</p>
<p>Works as Cerwyn&rsquo;s hand, though covertly and in a small capacity.</p>
<h2 id="the-cran-home-of-the-shadow-guild">The Cran, Home of the Shadow Guild.</h2>
<p>This place is the front of a legendary guild known as the Shadow Guild.
The business is in truth a brothel, but it also holds its secrets.</p>
<p>A band of mercenary outlaws. They do crimes, but only for the right cause, and the right coin both.
Harald, Doorman.
Kitty is the owner of the establishment, and is a cheerful, suggestive sort.</p>
<p>The Shadow Guild hideout is within one of the whore&rsquo;s rooms, behind a false panel in the closet.
You descend two stories of stone steps before arriving at a dirty door in the stone, which opens into a natural cavern.
A stream runs through the middle of this place, which is lit by torchlight.</p>
<p>Curl, the Brain.
Jain, the Brawn.
Ivory, the Fingers.
Kevan, the Blade. - Deceased.</p>
<h2 id="eckhardts---fineries--and-slaveries-">Eckhardt&rsquo;s - Fineries ( And slaveries )</h2>
<p>This is the proprieter of the finest clothes and wares of the west.
Eckhardt, the owner, is also the one through whom the Blackbirds were selling their slaves.
He has two slaves right now, both of Aqian descent.</p>
<p>His place is at the edge of town, and has a secret tunnel out of the city where he does his business through.</p>
<p><em>James</em> Is the primary Blackbird informer here.</p>
<h2 id="donnel---forge-and-leatherworking">Donnel - Forge and Leatherworking</h2>
<p>Donnel has most services for sale, and a great many good pieces here too.
He&rsquo;s the brother of Walter, from Khmer. They&rsquo;re both Lankhmari smiths, though Donnel has more chance to forge real steel.</p>
<h2 id="the-stone-bridge">The Stone Bridge</h2>
<p>The largest Inn in Emory beds up to 50, or near enough, and it does so cheaply.
The main selling point</p>
<p><em>Orys</em> is the innkeep, a bawdy, raucous man with a booming laugh and a sharp tongue.
<em>Pot Boy</em> helps him.</p>
<p>Other travellers in the Stone Bridge include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Lem</em>, a member of the Shadow Guild, working as a bard.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Trundle Gorm</em>, a sword hand for hire. He&rsquo;ll charge a silver a day to escort travellers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Bart Bracken</em>, a known thug who picks fights almost as often as he drinks himself to senselessness.
He has a pack of louts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Curtain Eater</em> Was the old leader of the bunch.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Gunther Trant</em>, a knight of House Trant, a local house of the Verdane.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Bram Jorah</em>, a knight of House Jorah, of Umber.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-fold-of-chanterelle">The Fold of Chanterelle</h2>
<p>This building holds the honor of being the largest in Emory, with a tall steeple four stories high, and a great bell exposed at the top.</p>
<p>the Priest here is named <em>Wendyn</em>, and he makes an effective sermon.
If he learns of Asha&rsquo;s growth powers, he will try to proclaim her as a prophet, and make for a big deal of it.
He is an honest enough man, seeking only to fill his bread bowl, and he tries to help the small folk.
There are a lot of poor people in this city, and they find hope in the promise of nature&rsquo;s bounty.</p>
<h2 id="old-emory">Old Emory</h2>
<p>A two-hour&rsquo;s walk from Emory, to the south.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a ruin, picked clean by looters over the fifty years since its destruction and abandonment.
The place was taken by the Blackbird bandits during the War of the Ninth Century.
King Warren and the Knights of Errol took the city back, and saved the people, but the city was destroyed.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the tale, but in truth, the city was retaken, and reconstruction began, but a dark spirit had inhabited the earth beneath the city, and the King had the city sealed.
The Crypt was sealed, with the great knights of the retaking buried beneath.
Among them was Robin Trant and his Knights of Glory.</p>
<h1 id="helios">Helios</h1>
<p>The city of the main road of Errol.

<h1 id="katalon-city">Katalon City</h1>
<h2 id="prince-faisal">Prince Faisal</h2>
<p>Faisal is the heir to the Katalon.
He is the last of the old blood of the west.</p>
<p>He seeks the keystone in the precipice and the lands beyond, as some way to ensure a future.
His mother had prophecied the thing, and he seeks it against his father&rsquo;s command.</p>
<p>Faisal made his way to Errol, but was unable to establish an audience with the King due to Lady Cerwyn.
He did, however, discover The Sorcerer Neral&rsquo;s prophecy, and attempted to return with that knowledge.
He was captured by the blackbirds before a chance encounter with the party, where they rescued him.
Captain Moss was ordered to ensure his return to his home country. However, the party ensured the prince&rsquo;s escape from Errol.
He returned to the Farwatch under the protection of Pascal, Guard of Errol.</p>
<h2 id="king-katalon">King Katalon</h2>
<p>The King Faisal, the Eighth of his Name, is descended from the Katalon Sultans of old.</p>
<p>A kindhearted man, who has watched the realm he is sworn to lead crumble, due to factors both within and beyond his control.
Through this, he grows weary, uncertain, and brash.
But in his country&rsquo;s most dire hour of need, he now will seek whatever solutions he can - at whatever cost to pride or his self.</p>

<p>Nadya was wife to Katalon and prime sorceress of the sands before her passing at the hands of Abrash riders a decade past.

<h2 id="ayaz">Ayaz</h2>
<p>A place which was once the Jewel of the Nafud.
The veritable Babylon of its time, it has fallen to ruin.
Now, the streets are filled with Shades, and its people scatter and hide.</p>
<p>Its location in the center of the Nafud once made it a hub for travel to all corners of the wastes.
Its single great well brought endless water to what most felt was a paradise among the sands.
But its time is come, and it is like any other ruined citadel.</p>
<h1 id="aqia-city">Aqia City</h1>
<p>The furthest East of the great desert cities, Aqia is an independent mercantile city under the command of a rotating cabinet of merchant princes.
These princes generally descend from wealthy families, and broker power and wealth among themselves.

They are called the Council of Aqia, and their judgements are absolute when unanimous.</p>
<h2 id="shamir-merchant-of-the-far-west">Shamir, Merchant of the Far West.</h2>
<p>Though Shamir comes only from the nearby Oasis city of Aqia, Emory says Shamir is from the &ldquo;Far West&rdquo;, a place he speaks of often and theatrically.</p>
<p>As for his living, he goes by the title of &ldquo;Merchant&rdquo;, though selling his strange and unknown ware has never once brought him a profit.</p>
<p>His face is adorned with a constant, unfailing grin, alongside a deep gash of a scar through his top lip, all the way down to his now-forked tongue.</p>
<p>Shamir will sell all of the following, and is willing to haggle with someone who sees the futility of his sales here:</p>
<ul>
<li>An assortment of jambiya, the knife of choice in the Gray Wastes. He&rsquo;ll sell them for 1-4 Gold, depending on the make. The finest blades will earn respect among the desert folk.</li>
<li>An El-Darakah, a kind of leathern shield which is light but extremely sturdy, going for 15 Gold in Emory, or so he says.</li>
<li>A conical helm, meant to be worn under a turban. 7 Gold.</li>
<li>A strange brew from the West - what he calls a &ldquo;Miracle Cure&rdquo;, of murky green water. 5 Silver.</li>
<li>A Recurve Bow of a hunter&rsquo;s make. Has a particularly light feel, and provides a +1 bonus to hit. 15 Gold.</li>
<li>A lone Kindjal, a straight sword forged in the Desert Cities of the West. A fine blade, never dulled. 15 Gold.</li>

<p>The center of the Myelar&rsquo;s remaining power in this land.
It is invisible to the human eye.

<p>Here there are a number of Myelar, who are dying slowly, blinking to preserve their longevity.</p>
<h1 id="organizations">Organizations</h1>
<h1 id="the-shadow-guild">The Shadow Guild</h1>
<p>A brotherhood of honest thieves.
The Robin Hood types, but they take few jobs, and do not take any reward for their exploits.</p>
<h1 id="the-blackbirds">The Blackbirds</h1>
<p>A band of brigands on the Precipice.
Covertly funded by the Marconi Family of the far east to investigate the supernatural claims of one of the last living sorcerers.</p>
<p>They are dead now.
Only Geoffrey remains, with a whip and a pike, and a broken arm, and Garreth, though he is a blackbird no longer.</p>
<h2 id="geoffrey">Geoffrey</h2>
<p>Leader, built the Blackbirds from nothing. His tongue procures deals with lords, as well as the loyalty of his brigand brethren.
He is not a strong man, but his cruelty is feared. He&rsquo;s young.</p>
<h2 id="garreth">Garreth</h2>
<p>an aging brigand, who did not always live this life. But a chance encounter with the law had him stripped of his knightly
valor and exiled to the gray wastes. A decade spent in the harsh sands weakened his resolve, and led him back to Errol, but as a brigand.</p>
<ul>
<li>He had a special connection with Alice.</li>
<li>He has survived the battle at Blackstone Keep. He now wanders the wilderness in search of a new cause.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ronan">Ronan</h2>
<p>Was a shaggy-haired brute of a man, the brawn of the Blackbirds.</p>

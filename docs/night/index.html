<p>Notes</p>
<p>The Wasteland. Reread the wasteland!</p>
<p>One character should be a priest, who commends you for your commitment, and commands you to follow the path up the hill.</p>
<p>A part of the game should be in a hospital waiting room</p>
<p>We should have gameplay which breeds uncertainty, like the player doesn&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s the right thing to do in a given situation</p>
<p>Purgation - to purify
Purgatory - suffering</p>
<p>Phantom vs fantasy</p>
<p>Maybe worth reading the divine comedy?</p>
<p>This work is a humbling experience. For all the work that you might do to seek your goal, there is still an infinite distance to go.</p>
<p>Perhaps when the player arrives at their destination, it shows that they have travelled such and such a long way, but it ends up being vast, vast leagues to go. Like they&rsquo;re just a pixel at the end.</p>
<p>A dream. A game with intense dream sequences</p>
<p>Kaibe is a good inspiration too, but i really shouldn&rsquo;t have too many more movie influences</p>
<p>David lynch made eraserhead with almost entirely art-based influences, and that works.
I wonder if we can pull off the same sort of thing with games and movie influences.</p>
<p>Idk&hellip; the gameplay still needs to feel really good&hellip; like it&rsquo;s mesmerizing in some way!</p>
<p>Elric of Melnibone</p>
<p>Boy is the world a lonely place! How quickly you feel it too.</p>
<p>I think i want this wasteland game to have some real life stuff.
Like you should slowly accumulate noise, until it&rsquo;s loud enough to hear all the time, and it sort of overpowers the music a little bit.
And i want the character to sort of worry about their health, but not be able to do anything about it, like me with this medicine right now - could clot at any moment, but hopeless to stop it.</p>
<p>These things can be less obvious / more abstract, but they really matter to me.</p>
<p>Limbo is the clearest analogue we have in games. Or Little Nightmares.</p>
<p>I really love the premise of doing the dialogue cutscenes like the Mask Salesman in Majora&rsquo;s mask. Where you do smash cuts to the guy in each animation. It also is like the scene from the Tatami Galaxy movie, where the guy is drunk and talking about stuff. Would be easy for mia to add some more animations to the rigs.</p>
<p>Will have to think carefully about light and shadow in godot. Put some thought into it.</p>

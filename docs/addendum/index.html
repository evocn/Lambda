<h2 id="equipment-and-trading">Equipment and Trading</h2>
<p><em><strong>Currency</strong></em> |
Trade in this setting typically involves the trading hands of various coins.</p>
<p>In the Four Kingdoms, the standard coin is the Golden Mark.</p>
<p>The most common coin in the Grey Wastes is the Silver Dirham. Also traded is the more valuable Golden Dinar.
The Dinar is a smaller coin than the Dirham, but is heavier.</p>
<p>As a reference point, most people will trade 10:1 between Silver Dirham and Golden Dinar.
Between the Four Kingdoms and the Grey Wastes, the Golden Mark usually trades one-to-one for the Dinar, but not all merchants will accept this.
The two coins have nearly the same weight, however.</p>
<p>These coins are forged in the great cities, and circulate through many realms.
There are various other forms of coin, which have regional popularity, and will only be traded by certain folk.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For simplicity, this guide will refer only to an item&rsquo;s value in terms of Gold, and will abbreviate this as GP.</p>

<p><em><strong>Estimation</strong></em> |
Below is a list of commonly found weapons, armor, and gear, along with typical prices for good quality pieces in populated areas.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that buying used weaponry can be cheaper, but weapons purchased secondhand can be unreliable, and might need honing at a smithy.
Note also that these prices are typical in populated areas, but in small hovels, a weapon may be considered far more valuable.</p>

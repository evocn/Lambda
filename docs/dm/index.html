<p><strong>The Heist</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>Hyal&rsquo;s Revelation</p>
<ul>
<li>Had a dream that he was in the library he remembers from long ago, and that he lived there for a long time.</li>
<li>He remembers looking up at Maegor&rsquo;s Peak through the window of his study.</li>
<li>He remembers that there was a book there which mentioned The Darkness. He thinks if he can reclaim that book, he&rsquo;ll get his memories back!</li>
</ul>
<p>Journey to Neral&rsquo;s Tower</p>
<ul>
<li>The party journeys North, keeping close eye on the river to the West, and the White Woods to the Northeast.</li>
<li>They travel three hours unperturbed, climbing their way out of the fertile valley of Emory.</li>
<li>At around 2 miles out, they have an encounter with a scouting party from Neral&rsquo;s Tower.
<ul>
<li>Four Ghouls on Horse. They&rsquo;re leisurely making a round of this area. It seems like they keep a perimeter around the space here.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In order to get close to the Tower, the party will need to either sneak past, defeat, or trick these folks and other scouting parties like them.
<ul>
<li>There are five total scouting parties, four of which are active and one of which remains in the keep during the day. At night, all parties rest.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Heist</p>
<ul>
<li>The Heist should probably go smoothly, if the party comes up with a good plan.</li>
</ul>
<p>Davon&rsquo;s Keep</p>
<ul>
<li>The Party approaches the keep proper at around midday.</li>
<li>The area around the keep is scourged. Burnt and sundered.</li>
<li>The landscape is mostly bare, but in the area around the keep, there&rsquo;s a sizable number of creatures.
<ul>
<li>30 Goblins, crawling in and out of small holes in the earth, and interacting with eachother when they encounter eachother.</li>
<li>10 Ghouls, some resting, but some are up, hauling human bodies using sleds.</li>
<li>The party sees the Ghouls and their steeds haul a full cart of these bodies through the front gate and portcullis of the keep, then close it behind themselves.</li>
<li>Finally, two Dark Beasts float high above the Keep, watching Maegor&rsquo;s Peak and the storm there. They&rsquo;re like Sentries.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The party can make a round of the Keep.
<ul>
<li>The earth is bare for a half-mile in most directions.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s up on a hill, with wooden stakes busying the landscape at the foot of the keep.</li>
<li>There appears to be sturdy walls all around the perimeter. Lance notices just one vulnerability to that - a sinking foundation on the Northern side, which could be pulled apart given some time.</li>
<li>The walls are easily climbed by Alice, who could make her way in at any time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Within the Keep, the party can sense Dark Magic.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Courtyard</p>
<ul>
<li>A dozen Ghouls stand here, working at intricate carvings in the earth underfoot.</li>
<li>The Courtyard is an open area, with the walls climbing forty feet around you.</li>
<li>The main directions to go are in or around the main Hall, Up the stairs leading to the top of the walls, and into the great Spire of the Wizard&rsquo;s Tower.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Body Pit</p>
<ul>
<li>All the bodies are hauled from the piles outside to a back corner of the Courtyard.</li>
<li>Here, a few unlucky Ghouls remove the bodies, then take them through a secret underground tunnel into the basement of the great hall.</li>
<li>There&rsquo;s only a couple Ghouls in one location.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Lobby</p>
<ul>
<li>An open space, with pedestals and carvings around the outside of the room.
<ul>
<li>There used to be art and artifacts here, but now there is nothing but shattered ceramic and rent metal.
<ul>
<li>You can see a spearhead, a broken staff, a torn cloak, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A spiral stair in the corner of the room leads up to the tower proper.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Wizard&rsquo;s Tower</p>
<ul>
<li>The place smells like&hellip; Hyal? Very close smell.</li>
<li>He&rsquo;s getting new memories all the time.</li>
<li>The Stairs lead upwards, where soggy papers are strewn all along the stairs.
<ul>
<li>You can look out from the windows onto the courtyard below, and the Dark Beasts resting high above in the sky. They are aloof to your presence.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s a library, filled with books.</p>
<ul>
<li>Eugenia and Lance get started right away, checking all the books they can.
<ul>
<li>Books on Botany, Natural Philosophy, History. Mathematics.</li>
<li>Some books of sorcery, but the real texts are in the Wizard&rsquo;s Chambers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A Study, the room of Hyal.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fables, stories, and books of riddles.</li>
<li>Hyal becomes emotional, and starts to remember things.</li>
<li>&ldquo;This was my home. Which means&hellip; I must have been taught by the wizard who lived here!&rdquo;</li>
<li>He still doesn&rsquo;t remember much about the wizard or why he left, how he came here, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Wizard&rsquo;s Chambers</p>
<ul>
<li>Dark Magic Spells!
<ul>
<li>Counter Spell</li>
<li>Murder</li>
<li>Reincarnate</li>
<li>Flux</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Revelation of Hyal&rsquo;s Memories</p>
<p>Trap!</p>
<ul>
<li>Hyal turns, or maybe the two Horsemen show up, or Neral has set a trap. It would be really cool to put the players in the trunk and start driving the car.</li>
</ul>
<p>Fight!</p>
<ul>
<li>The Sworn Swords protect Eugenia. The party is divided. Overwhelmed. The center cannot hold.</li>
</ul>
<p>Separation of the group?</p>
<ul>
<li>In the climactic battle, a great explosion is set to go off, but Eugenia has the chance to warp everyone away with her new spells, though she doesn&rsquo;t know where to.
I love the idea of choosing pairs to travel now, and making people have to work on their own to survive for a time.</li>

<h2 id="how-does-this-whole-fuckin-thing-come-together">How does this whole fuckin thing come together?</h2>
<h3 id="long-ago">Long Ago</h3>
<p>Long ago, the Myelar create the world. They hang out in this nice place they call Elturel.</p>
<p>Human Beings, originally from far, far away across the ocean and the mountains, migrate into the land of the Myelar.
They find a utopia! Inhabited by awesome elf people who have advanced technology!</p>
<p>The Myelar are benevolent, and let the people stay in their lands.
They don&rsquo;t understand eachother, you see, but the Myelar are friendly hosts.
They have nice feasts, and they hang out just fine.
Some Myelar even teach some little secrets about magic and technology to the primitive humans.
Human Civilization in Elturel is the most advanced on the planet.</p>
<p>But at some point, things start to go bad. Some of the people start to get upset about the way the elves run the lands.
They start talking about the elves like they&rsquo;re proud or something, like they&rsquo;re making fun of the people.</p>
<p>To make matters worse, the elves start acting strange. Some of the elves start acting sort of like the people, being proud and taking things personally.
They worry about the people and their weapons, and start to think about kicking them out of their lands again.
But most of the elves still felt pretty generous, and it just didn&rsquo;t feel right kicking them out of this nice land.
Most of the people had come from lands which were war-torn and dangerous. This is a place where all these people could really get along.</p>
<p>Something changed one day when a person killed a Myelar for the first time.
It was a sin - an act of rage and malice, without justice behind it to motivate.</p>
<p>And while in life, the Myelar was a gentle sort of elf, with a kind spirit and goodwill towards his human neighbors,
when he fell, something terrible happened! A Myelar had never been killed in malice before, so they had no idea what would happen.
Out of his body sprang a wicked pox, a sickness which filled the air. It was like some evil thing was within him, and since he was a Myelar - so full of power - it was very strong.
The thing spread, methodically killing humans and scarring them with a black pus.
Worse, when they buried the dead humans and myelar elves, about a week later, they came back from the dead, as these wretched little things they called goblins or gremlins or shades.
They were insatiable to kill humans and elves alike - like they were driven by some anti-life spirit of death.</p>
<p>Eventually, the elves got the thing controlled, and tried to figure out what had caused it, but they were blind to their own feelings.
The corruption had already spread to all of them, and they couldn&rsquo;t clearly distinguish that they were upset. That they were mourning!</p>
<p>So crimes of this kind began to be more common, and people started to plan in big groups what kinds of things they were going to do to fight the Myelar.
There was eventually a big war, since the people wanted revenge, and so did the elves. They weren&rsquo;t that different in the end.
Pretty much everyone died, and it was even kind of close, since the Myelar were split between those that fought the humans and those which fought the corrupt elves.</p>
<p>Things were really pretty bad, so eventually, there was this big sacrifice where the Myelar kings shattered their crowns to seal the goblins underground,
destroy the darkness, and make a peace.
The Myelar gave up the west of Elturel for the people to live in, and made a bunch of mountains to keep the people out of the East.
They stayed away from eachother for a long time.</p>
<p>The West became this gnarly desert, where hardly anything grew.
It was hard for the people, but they learned how to live in the inhospitable environment.
Eventually, it had been long enough for the people to have forgotten the last war.
The Myelar and the Nefud (as they called themselves) became friends again. The Myelar gave them little gifts and stuff.
The Nefud, since they were so humbled by their environment, just appreciated it all. It was a good time.</p>
<p>But the Myelar saw things they feared. They were still sensitive.
So they were divided, eventually fighting among themselves.
The Goblin creatures they slayed in the last war all rose from the dead as soon as things got bad.
And the Myelar&rsquo;s powers were weaker than ever since they shattered the crowns.</p>
<p>Anyways, after a long civil war, the last remaining Myelar got together and made a plan.
They&rsquo;d make the world hospitable for the human beings, and leave them the verdant lands of Elturel to live in.
They&rsquo;d seal the darkness, and make everything right. Then, they would leave this world.</p>
<p>They did it, and only a few Myelar remained in the East, dedicated to being wardens over the darkness for humankind.</p>
<p>Eventually, the Nefud found that their Myelar friends were gone. They were sad and mourned for years. They told stories about the people.
But slowly they found their way to the East, where things were green and good.</p>
<p>They founded kingdoms in the old Myelar Citadels, and prospered for 1000 years.
Of course, they fought like people often do, but they did so in the ways of men, in familiar ways to our world.
And things slowly improved, like in our world, too.</p>
<h3 id="recent-history">Recent History</h3>
<p>So that peace lasted for 1000 years. The Myelar all went away back then, except a few stragglers, Myelar who were born near the end
who still had more to learn before they went on to the next life.
That&rsquo;s like what Asha is. She was born right after the Exodus, and she had to figure out life on her own.</p>
<p>So back to today.
We&rsquo;ve got the Nefud in the West, in tribes, sticking it out in the Desert.
We&rsquo;ve got the Four Kingdoms in Elturel, who each have their own history and quarrels and whatever.
There&rsquo;s even been some wars between the Nefud and the Kingdoms, but mostly the Precipice keeps them to themselves.
There&rsquo;s still some old wizards and magic-knowers who carry on the traditions of the Myelar, but their powers wane, and it&rsquo;s mostly a mundane world.
In the Nefud, there&rsquo;s still magic blood from the Myelar passed down by the Sorcerer Queens!</p>
<p>The people of both lands worship gods whose stories are sort of all tied in with the real-life history of the Myelar.
There&rsquo;s an order of paladins called the Knights of Torm, the Monks of the Moon, and some other groups with religious bent,
but for the most part folk care about their lives and try to keep their lords happy.</p>
<p>There was a big war about 50 years ago, when the folk of the Verdane tried to claim the Imperial Throne from the Reuss.
It was all orchestrated by the Marconi of the far East, but it all came to naught.
Lots of bloodshed, for nothing. Since then, it&rsquo;s been all peace and rebuilding. Swords to Plowshares and all that.</p>
<h3 id="the-inciting-incident">The Inciting Incident</h3>
<p>So about a decade ago, something really crazy happened. It sort of set off everything that is happening now.</p>
<p>There was a wizard who figured out what had happened to the Myelar. Who pieced together that they willingly disappeared.
That Wizard was called Neral, and he was one of the last remaining master wizards in the Four Kingdoms.</p>
<p>So he figured out what happened, and he got to thinking&hellip; What if the Myelar really should have had this land in the first place?
I mean, his reasoning made sense at the time, he was just thinking about how the human beings who live here now were sort of unwelcome,
and they didn&rsquo;t really have the right to kick the Myelar out the way they did.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s sort of thinking about what it all means, when he meets this Myelar, the first one he&rsquo;s ever met.
The elf&rsquo;s name is Hyal. Hyal&rsquo;s a young Myelar, born after the Exodus, who has lived for 1000 years and watched the humans claim this land.</p>
<p>Hyal is sort of held against his will by Neral, though the two grow a sort of unsteady friendship.
Hyal is curious, and they have long discussions about what history means.
Neral is convinced that the Myelar have the right to this land. Meanwhile, Hyal doesn&rsquo;t really have a personal stake in the matter.</p>
<p>Eventually, Neral convinced Hyal to use his powers to connect to the souls of his ancestors, in the other world.
There, Hyal met his forefathers. The ones on the ledge between living and dead, in purgatory.
They told him to use Neral to try to reforge the Crown of Moonlight, to exterminate all the Goblins and reclaim Elturel for the Myelar.</p>
<p>So he returned to this world, sort of uncertain about what to do, but he grudgingly works with Neral on this reclaiming business.
They sort of investigate for a few years, then go off the grid. The last anyone heard of them, they were headed West.
No one knows what happened to those two.</p>
<p>Lady Cerwyn, the patron of Neral, discovered Neral&rsquo;s notes. She pieced together the same conclusions he did.
She brought this idea to the lords council of Errol, and even secretly to the Imperium.
She was generally rebuked, but many scholars began research into the documents Neral discovered.</p>
<p>It was at this point that Cerwyn was killed by Neral. Working through her as a puppet, Neral commanded the forbidden magic of possession
to use her power and influence to help him search for the keystone, hiring bandits across the world, both to help search and to spread disarray
among the kingdoms of men.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, Neral and Hyal discovered that in order to return the Crown of Moonlight to power, they needed to release the seal.
Hyal refused, but Neral forced him to. Past the point of no return, Neral unleashed the evil sealed away in the far West of the World, and the Dark Beasts
began resurrecting the Goblins buried beneath the sand as shades, and spreading across the desert sands.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Hyal managed to escape Neral&rsquo;s clutches. Blaming himself for what has happened, he set off to find the Crown of Moonlight, to seal the darkness.
By the time the party finds him, unconscious and nearly destroyed by darkness, He has found it, but it has come at a cost.</p>
<p>Anyways, the darkness spreads, and the Four Kingdoms find themselves utterly unprepared for it.</p>
<h3 id="now">Now</h3>
<p>The Darkness has spread. Neral&rsquo;s forces grow across nearly all of Errol at this point.
Along their path, old Myelar strongholds have kept them at bay for short periods of time.
But an army of Shades grows across the Four Kingdoms.
The Nefud are almost completely swarmed, and only the Citadels survive in the vast desert.
Assistance is coming from the East, but is slow to arrive. The Four are in disarray, and communication is difficult.</p>
<p>The Party has, through either sheer luck or savvy, discovered half of the Crown of Light.
They set out from Helios to unite the halves and hopefully save the realm.
Eugenia the sorceress and Asha the Myelar hold great potential in their souls,
and their companions Lazarus the warrior and Alice the thief have been essential to their travels.
Lance, their elderly leader, has led them this far, but his old bones can only take him so far. This is most likely his final journey.</p>
<p>Hyal, retaining most of the Crown of Moonlight, has made his way to the Verdane of Errol, but has been corrupted by his journey.
The party, as we know, has found him outside the city of Helios.</p>
<p>They, along with Hyal, Ser Robin of Torm, and Leonster Fairheart of Helios, have set out to Maegor&rsquo;s Peak for their ultimate goal:
To save the world from Darkness!</p>
<h3 id="the-future">The Future</h3>
<p>Neral and Sha&rsquo;virr stand locked in battle over the Nefud desert.
Sha&rsquo;virr will lose, and pass his powers on to Eugenia.</p>
<p>Neral will personally assault Maegor&rsquo;s Peak, and will stop the party from acquiring the Crown of Light.
Also Hyal will probably be kidnapped again, and turned into a godlike entity known as The Moonlight.</p>
<p>Eventually, the party will have to come up with some crafty way to defeat Neral and re-seal the darkness.
I want something which takes collaboration, coordination, and everyone&rsquo;s skills to do.
Like a real heist.</p>

## Session 19

Bookkeeping
* Lance will be considered "out" for this scenario. We will retroactively say that he remains outside, with the other group.
  * I will allow the party to change him out for another of the group. Shar, Gascoigne, or Lucia.
  * I will allow the party to change the telepathy around as well. We already have Shar, Alice, Lazarus, and ...
* Who has the half of the Crown of Light?


**The Heist**
Midday, heavy rainfall.
Two groups are within the walls of Davon's Keep. One remains without.
* Asha, Alice, and Eugenia sneak in the back way.
* Lazarus rides, feigning death, on a cart pulled by Hyal, disguised as a Shambler.
* Lucia, Shar, and Gascoigne remain outside with the animals, along with Lance.

### Dispatch!
FLY WITH THE WIND

The cart tilts backwards, revealing a hole in the earth behind Lazarus.
Lazarus rises from the pile of bodies, pulling his arm free from a slush of entrails, and kneels face-to-face with a Shambler.

(Alice's crew isn't quite around the building yet.)

Behind him and Hyal, he sees the courtyard. A half-dozen shamblers silently peer at the ground.
They haven't noticed the commotion, yet, but the nearest one is only 15 feet away.
Lazarus has only a couple moments to dispatch the guy before he makes a racket or the others see.

By the way, Hyal has a sword now, but he won't use it under any circumstances, unless his life is absolutely threatened.

### Setting the Scene
LONG PAST GONE

Once it's clear that the scene is safe, Laz and Hyal hide and survey the interior courtyard.
The rain pours, and the scene before you is as follows:

* Alice's group turns the corner around the back of the tower. They come upon a set of stables, where a pair of horses stand, rotting in their skin.
  * They might spook, so they'll have to be careful. They can move unseen under the wall of the stables around to get a clear view of the front door of the tower.

* It looks like the Shamblers here are carving some intricate patterns into the packed earth of the yard.
  They use picks made of those strange materials. It's a circle with runes they carve, and it goes deep with precision.
  Strange patterns, irrational shapes, yet so precise it must have some order to it.
  They move lifelessly, yet with intention behind every strike of the earth.
  * They will notice individuals moving obviously in the courtyard, though perhaps you could time a quick movement across the courtyard if you percieve the group well.
* The 

* Behind Laz, the pit looms. Mud-water slops down into its opening, slowly wearing away at the edges of the open wound in the earth.
  The top of The Pit is 30 feet down, meaning anyone dropping in will have to count on the bodies below softening their fall.
  It appears to be a natural cavern below, pitch dark and rancid from the smell of flesh and rain. 
  * It's a shaft straight down for a while, but you can see in the soft light that there appears to be more cavern through there.
  * Just for simplicity, I'd estimate someone dropping in would take 4 damage if they land on the top of the pile.

* The Tower is solid stone, and it's cool to the touch.
  * The door is stone, and is covered in runes. Eugenia can tell right away that it has a ward upon it.
    * Hyal knows the solution! It's a passcode. The word is "Restore"
    * Or, Eugenia can try to decipher it with a check.

* The Castle proper has another portcullis, with narrow slits for arrows.
  The only clear way in to this building is if you can open that portcullis, or perhaps there's a way in on the roof.
  * If someone peers within a slit or the portcullis, they will see that the building is occupied by Shamblers.
  Quite a few in there, but they move individually, not in groups. Through the main portcullis, though, the party can see
  * The other way in is through the Pit. It leads to the basement/bunker of the Castle, where refugees were often held in older wars.

* The Beast remains in the sky, its form transluecent and shifting.
  Alongside the rain, drips from it singe the earth below.
  * It is sensitive to change, but not too much.
  It's pretty much over for the party if the Dark Beast notices, since it acts with the will of Neral and will control all the Shamblers here.

### Split up once more!
794BDH

The Portcullis opens once more. Another huge cart, pulled by two shamblers and assisted by two goblins, walk slowly towards the hole.
Lazarus and Hyal cannot see them, as they're around the corner, but Alice's group communicates this to them.
* The pit is in an alleyway, but behind it is sheer wall. They'll be cornered if they don't think of something.
* They still have the half-full cart here with them, but only Lazarus and Hyal are here. Alice's group is across the courtyard, and would have difficulty sneaking over to help.
* They have just a little time to decide whether to dispose of the group, hide in the cart, or something else.

Hyal wants to go with the party up the tower. He'll have to find some way to get over there. He's still in costume.

Lazarus might end up wanting to go with the group, but the only downside is that Alice can only sneak a couple with her.
Anyways, we want to do both at once, and bounce between them, but if we have to do one at a time, that's okay too.

The party makes their way towards the points of interest - the Tower and the Castle (or the Pit)

### The Tower Lobby
FIRE DANCE

The interior of the tower is covered in dust. This place has been sealed for at least a couple years. Musty smell.
A tea-kettle hangs from the roof, and floor-chairs surround a central fire pit here.
* Hyal remembers this place. He finds traces of tea leaves on the floor - Jasmine.
* The Stairs lead upwards, where dusty papers are strewn all along the stairs. They're torn, wet, and dusty.
  Water has crept in through each arrow slit, and each window.
  * You can look out from the windows onto the courtyard below. The carvings still make little sense to you.

You climb the stairs curling around the interior wall of the tower, and find yourself on a second floor.
* Here, a ladder rises higher, nearly to the top of the tower, alongside a string/pulley system with a wooden basket.
* On this floor, there's a door leading to the majority of this floor. The Library.
* Above, halfway up the tower, there's a platform with a door which leads to Hyal's Study.

### The Library
GNOSIENNE

It's a library. Some books remain, but many are burnt or torn to pages.
Eugenia gets started right away, checking all the books they can.
* Books on Botany, Natural Philosophy, History. Mathematics.
* Some books of sorcery, but not much.

Hyal has a memory... He seems to remember where the book was! It's behind a hidden back panel to a bookshelf.
But when he opens it, it's gone!
* Otherwise, behind this false panel, there is one book of interest...
  A Book of Advanced Magic Spells! Since Eugenia is growing in power, these spells can be easily learnt in a short time.
  * Transmute | Convert HP into SP
  * Teleport | Travel long distances, at great strain to the self.
  * Counter Spell

* Along with those spells, Eugenia can learn Dark Magic.
  To learn Dark Magic is to halve your lifespan. It's a choice! She gets all or nothing!
  Dark Magic
  * Murder
  * Flux | Spread disease, a pox which will kill any creature without cure in 10 hours. It can be contagious to those who touch the diseased.
  * Reincarnate | Revive an intelligent creature as a zombie.


### The Study (Hyal's Room)
LANTERN

It's a small nook of a room. A child's room, really. Fables, stories, and books of riddles pack the shelves.

Hyal becomes emotional, and starts to remember things.
* "The Mystical Land of Elturel"... wow, this book meant so much to him. How could he have forgotten it?
* A time when he fell asleep at his desk, and his mentor covered him in a blanket.
* His bed.. it even still smells like him. It's neatly made.

PAUSE

He comes to the end of his memories. He can remember that he had a mentor, who was the wizard of this tower, but he seems to still have a block.

If the party tries to investigate a little further, they might be able to jog some memory.
Pick a word, and have Hyal laser in on that.
* He remembers one little thing. An undefined spot in his memory. Unthinkingly, he steps towards his desk, and pulls the knife from his hip.
  He pries off the oak of the desk, and underneath, there is a letter.
* Once Hyal sees the symbol left on the letter, his memories all return.
  He crumples to the ground, unconscious, then returns quickly.
  Once he wakes up, he completely changes his demeaner, even his face.

He looks, determinedly, into the eyes of Asha. "I remember everything."


### The Pit
The bodies are piled high. Eighty, at least. They're in various stages of decay.

There are no shamblers here, though there are terrifying Corpse-Spiders. Enough to challenge a couple adventurers.


### The Castle Lobby
MADNESS

The room is in ruins.
* There used to be art and artifacts here, but now there is nothing but shattered ceramic and rent metal.
  You can see a spearhead, a broken staff, a torn cloak, etc.
  * It's the place Eugenia saw Lady Cerwyn in her vision!
* Eight Shamblers stand in various postures, like frozen statues, in the middle of the room.
* A spiral stair in the corner of the room leads down into the Bunker.


### The Crypt
Here, where the dead of long ages are buried, There is only one creature's corpse above ground. Lady Cerwyn.

She lies here, with her heart pierced by a ruby blade. Crumpled on her knees, her corpse leans sideways against the largest crypt.
* That of King Waylon, one of the first kings of the people to one day be known as Errol.
* Around her wound, the decay has stopped in a near-perfect ring around the gash.
  * The Ruby Blade has the property of removing the Curse of Undeath from any being.

* I want the spirit of Cerwyn to shine through here, so the party can get answers as to her involvement, too.
  Up to you what the best way to do this is.


### The Whole Story
WIND SCENE

Hyal details his history here.

* He was born during the Shattering.
  * The Goblins? 

  * He lived through the Compromise, when Men lived in the West, and Myelar in the East. He remembers what happened next now.
  * The Men in the East invaded. He saw violence. His family left their home and went north, which was once verdant and green as the rest of the continent.

* He recalls that there was a compromise among the people of the Myelar. "The Exodus"
  * They were to seal all the darkness, the corruption away deep under the earth. The Goblins, Shamblers, and cruelty.
  * They were to foster groups of shepherds, who could lead Men, with some of the powers the Myelar possessed. Sorcerers and Sorceresses.
  * Then, when all is done, they were to leave the land to the likes of Man.
  * He remembers his mother little, and she left him in the Exodus.

* Once the Myelar left, there were only a spare few left. Only those who chose to remain behind and be stewards of the land.
* The North became frozen, frigid... A wasteland. Hyal tried to be a steward to men, but they were so different that he could not befriend them.

He changes his tone.

MAENEM

* He lived many long years, alone, in repose. In wonder at the world the Men built. How strange it was.
* He began to see that the Men would conquer all, that they would inhabit the structures of the Myelar. They would defile them.
* He saw their wars, their famines, and he was powerless to stop them.
* He saw the Exodus as a tragedy. The worst mistake of history. The world without the Myelar was set to rot, to die in filth and earth.
* He went into solitude, meditating on his rage for long years.
* He was frozen into a block of ice, lost to time.
* After nearly 1000 years, A group of Lankhmari miners found him. That's when Neral showed up, and adopted Hyal.
* He was an austere man, different from the rest. He felt that the world was rotten, just like Hyal.
  * Neral was a master wizard of Story, History, Memory. His specialty was on altering memories, recalling histories, and changing sentiment.

* Hyal's education began. He learned about the ways of the world.
* He had long discussions with Neral about the Myelar, the Exodus, and The Shattering.
* Neral informed Hyal of a... different possibility that history did not make come to pass.

JAPANESE SONG

* Hyal describes "The Cleansing".
  * It matches up well with the apocalypse happening now.
  * Hyal denies being for the cleansing now, stating that he changed his mind later. He seems genuinely sorry for his prior beliefs.
* He went with Neral on a journey around the continent, to see the various locations of Myelar history.
  They went on archeological digs throughout the Four Kingdoms, eventually setting off for the Wastes.
* They found, at the foot of the End of the World, something terrifying.
  The seal with which the Myelar held the Darkness.
  * (Lazarus might know something about this. The End of the World is forbidden by Nefud as an accursed place, with good reason.)

* Neral wanted to release the seal, complete The Cleansing, and bring the world to its final, austere end. To bring Death to this miserable place.
* Hyal, realizing what that entailed, objected. He opposed Neral's will.
  But Neral, a grandmaster wizard, was able to defeat Hyal, cursing him to lose his memory.
  * Hyal, thankfully, left himself that letter, since he had suspected that Neral might cast such a spell on him someday.
  * The letter had the counter-rune for the curse of Memory.

### Neral's Study
LONG PAST GONE

The trapdoor opens into a large room. It's a laboratory.
Implements for various chemical experiments litter the tables.
The walls are covered in charts of the stars, and of pages from books / notes.

The floor has a painted circle for spell-casting, though its pattern is unfamiliar to you, Eugenia.
(Hyal will lie if he is asked about it).

Nearly everything is burnt, smashed, or wrecked.

Hyal remembers this place, too. He says this is where Neral and he would have discussions.
He says they cleared out all they could find before they left to the wastes.
They didn't want their research to be found and misinterpreted.

### The Betrayal
DARKENING GROUND

This is where Hyal turns the tables on the party.
He will have some scheme to take Asha hostage, and the rest he will make demands of.

There are some pretty foolproof spells which Hyal can use, since he has his memories and his spells back.
He claims to be able to kill any single one of them with a look.
He can freeze the room here in time.
He can summon Dark Beasts.
He can counter Eugenia's spells.


Either...
* He tries to teleport the party to a faraway place, as he doesn't want them to get hurt, but he cannot have them interfering.
* He tries to kill the party, but they manage to escape by using the teleportation circle.

Or alternatively,
* Neral's trap is sprung, warping all four of the group, including Hyal himself.
(This is for if you don't want to make Hyal the villain).

When the warp occurs, there is a great flash of blue light from the top of the tower. All can see.

The rain pours. A storm brews. Lance / Shar are stunned. Just a moment before, the skies were just gray, but now a great Tempest has appeared.

### The Escape
???

As the remaining two leave the complex, they recieve word of what has happened, and must cope with that.
The Escape should be trivial, but the big circle might still be dealt with, etc.

The Storm begins, and the Dark Beast will be extra strong / watchful.

## How does this whole fuckin thing come together?
### Long Ago
Long ago, the Myelar create the world. They hang out in this nice place they call Elturel.

Human Beings, originally from far, far away across the ocean and the mountains, migrate into the land of the Myelar.
They find a utopia! Inhabited by awesome elf people who have advanced technology!

The Myelar are benevolent, and let the people stay in their lands.
They don't understand eachother, you see, but the Myelar are friendly hosts.
They have nice feasts, and they hang out just fine. 
Some Myelar even teach some little secrets about magic and technology to the primitive humans.
Human Civilization in Elturel is the most advanced on the planet.

But at some point, things start to go bad. Some of the people start to get upset about the way the elves run the lands.
They start talking about the elves like they're proud or something, like they're making fun of the people.

To make matters worse, the elves start acting strange. Some of the elves start acting sort of like the people, being proud and taking things personally.
They worry about the people and their weapons, and start to think about kicking them out of their lands again.
But most of the elves still felt pretty generous, and it just didn't feel right kicking them out of this nice land.
Most of the people had come from lands which were war-torn and dangerous. This is a place where all these people could really get along.

Something changed one day when a person killed a Myelar for the first time.
It was a sin - an act of rage and malice, without justice behind it to motivate.

And while in life, the Myelar was a gentle sort of elf, with a kind spirit and goodwill towards his human neighbors,
when he fell, something terrible happened! A Myelar had never been killed in malice before, so they had no idea what would happen.
Out of his body sprang a wicked pox, a sickness which filled the air. It was like some evil thing was within him, and since he was a Myelar - so full of power - it was very strong.
The thing spread, methodically killing humans and scarring them with a black pus.
Worse, when they buried the dead humans and myelar elves, about a week later, they came back from the dead, as these wretched little things they called goblins or gremlins or shades.
They were insatiable to kill humans and elves alike - like they were driven by some anti-life spirit of death.

Eventually, the elves got the thing controlled, and tried to figure out what had caused it, but they were blind to their own feelings.
The corruption had already spread to all of them, and they couldn't clearly distinguish that they were upset. That they were mourning!

So crimes of this kind began to be more common, and people started to plan in big groups what kinds of things they were going to do to fight the Myelar.
There was eventually a big war, since the people wanted revenge, and so did the elves. They weren't that different in the end.
Pretty much everyone died, and it was even kind of close, since the Myelar were split between those that fought the humans and those which fought the corrupt elves.

Things were really pretty bad, so eventually, there was this big sacrifice where the Myelar kings shattered their crowns to seal the goblins underground,
destroy the darkness, and make a peace.
The Myelar gave up the west of Elturel for the people to live in, and made a bunch of mountains to keep the people out of the East.
They stayed away from eachother for a long time.

The West became this gnarly desert, where hardly anything grew.
It was hard for the people, but they learned how to live in the inhospitable environment.
Eventually, it had been long enough for the people to have forgotten the last war.
The Myelar and the Nefud (as they called themselves) became friends again. The Myelar gave them little gifts and stuff.
The Nefud, since they were so humbled by their environment, just appreciated it all. It was a good time.

But the Myelar saw things they feared. They were still sensitive.
So they were divided, eventually fighting among themselves.
The Goblin creatures they slayed in the last war all rose from the dead as soon as things got bad.
And the Myelar's powers were weaker than ever since they shattered the crowns.

Anyways, after a long civil war, the last remaining Myelar got together and made a plan.
They'd make the world hospitable for the human beings, and leave them the verdant lands of Elturel to live in.
They'd seal the darkness, and make everything right. Then, they would leave this world.

They did it, and only a few Myelar remained in the East, dedicated to being wardens over the darkness for humankind.

Eventually, the Nefud found that their Myelar friends were gone. They were sad and mourned for years. They told stories about the people.
But slowly they found their way to the East, where things were green and good.

They founded kingdoms in the old Myelar Citadels, and prospered for 1000 years.
Of course, they fought like people often do, but they did so in the ways of men, in familiar ways to our world.
And things slowly improved, like in our world, too.

### Recent History
So that peace lasted for 1000 years. The Myelar all went away back then, except a few stragglers, Myelar who were born near the end
who still had more to learn before they went on to the next life.
That's like what Asha is. She was born right after the Exodus, and she had to figure out life on her own.

So back to today.
We've got the Nefud in the West, in tribes, sticking it out in the Desert.
We've got the Four Kingdoms in Elturel, who each have their own history and quarrels and whatever.
There's even been some wars between the Nefud and the Kingdoms, but mostly the Precipice keeps them to themselves.
There's still some old wizards and magic-knowers who carry on the traditions of the Myelar, but their powers wane, and it's mostly a mundane world.
In the Nefud, there's still magic blood from the Myelar passed down by the Sorcerer Queens!

The people of both lands worship gods whose stories are sort of all tied in with the real-life history of the Myelar.
There's an order of paladins called the Knights of Torm, the Monks of the Moon, and some other groups with religious bent,
but for the most part folk care about their lives and try to keep their lords happy.

There was a big war about 50 years ago, when the folk of the Verdane tried to claim the Imperial Throne from the Reuss.
It was all orchestrated by the Marconi of the far East, but it all came to naught.
Lots of bloodshed, for nothing. Since then, it's been all peace and rebuilding. Swords to Plowshares and all that.

### The Inciting Incident
So about a decade ago, something really crazy happened. It sort of set off everything that is happening now.

There was a wizard who figured out what had happened to the Myelar. Who pieced together that they willingly disappeared.
That Wizard was called Neral, and he was one of the last remaining master wizards in the Four Kingdoms.

So he figured out what happened, and he got to thinking... What if the Myelar really should have had this land in the first place?
I mean, his reasoning made sense at the time, he was just thinking about how the human beings who live here now were sort of unwelcome,
and they didn't really have the right to kick the Myelar out the way they did.

He's sort of thinking about what it all means, when he meets this Myelar, the first one he's ever met.
The elf's name is Hyal. Hyal's a young Myelar, born after the Exodus, who has lived for 1000 years and watched the humans claim this land.

Hyal is sort of held against his will by Neral, though the two grow a sort of unsteady friendship.
Hyal is curious, and they have long discussions about what history means.
Neral is convinced that the Myelar have the right to this land. Meanwhile, Hyal doesn't really have a personal stake in the matter.

Eventually, Neral convinced Hyal to use his powers to connect to the souls of his ancestors, in the other world.
There, Hyal met his forefathers. The ones on the ledge between living and dead, in purgatory.
They told him to use Neral to try to reforge the Crown of Moonlight, to exterminate all the Goblins and reclaim Elturel for the Myelar.

So he returned to this world, sort of uncertain about what to do, but he grudgingly works with Neral on this reclaiming business.
They sort of investigate for a few years, then go off the grid. The last anyone heard of them, they were headed West.
No one knows what happened to those two.

Lady Cerwyn, the patron of Neral, discovered Neral's notes. She pieced together the same conclusions he did.
She brought this idea to the lords council of Errol, and even secretly to the Imperium.
She was generally rebuked, but many scholars began research into the documents Neral discovered.

It was at this point that Cerwyn was killed by Neral. Working through her as a puppet, Neral commanded the forbidden magic of possession
to use her power and influence to help him search for the keystone, hiring bandits across the world, both to help search and to spread disarray
among the kingdoms of men.

In the meanwhile, Neral and Hyal discovered that in order to return the Crown of Moonlight to power, they needed to release the seal.
Hyal refused, but Neral forced him to. Past the point of no return, Neral unleashed the evil sealed away in the far West of the World, and the Dark Beasts
began resurrecting the Goblins buried beneath the sand as shades, and spreading across the desert sands.

Meanwhile, Hyal managed to escape Neral's clutches. Blaming himself for what has happened, he set off to find the Crown of Moonlight, to seal the darkness.
By the time the party finds him, unconscious and nearly destroyed by darkness, He has found it, but it has come at a cost.

Anyways, the darkness spreads, and the Four Kingdoms find themselves utterly unprepared for it.

### Now
The Darkness has spread. Neral's forces grow across nearly all of Errol at this point.
Along their path, old Myelar strongholds have kept them at bay for short periods of time.
But an army of Shades grows across the Four Kingdoms.
The Nefud are almost completely swarmed, and only the Citadels survive in the vast desert.
Assistance is coming from the East, but is slow to arrive. The Four are in disarray, and communication is difficult.

The Party has, through either sheer luck or savvy, discovered half of the Crown of Light.
They set out from Helios to unite the halves and hopefully save the realm.
Eugenia the sorceress and Asha the Myelar hold great potential in their souls,
and their companions Lazarus the warrior and Alice the thief have been essential to their travels.
Lance, their elderly leader, has led them this far, but his old bones can only take him so far. This is most likely his final journey.

Hyal, retaining most of the Crown of Moonlight, has made his way to the Verdane of Errol, but has been corrupted by his journey.
The party, as we know, has found him outside the city of Helios.

They, along with Hyal, Ser Robin of Torm, and Leonster Fairheart of Helios, have set out to Maegor's Peak for their ultimate goal:
To save the world from Darkness!

### The Future
Neral and Sha'virr stand locked in battle over the Nefud desert.
Sha'virr will lose, and pass his powers on to Eugenia.

Neral will personally assault Maegor's Peak, and will stop the party from acquiring the Crown of Light.
Also Hyal will probably be kidnapped again, and turned into a godlike entity known as The Moonlight.

Eventually, the party will have to come up with some crafty way to defeat Neral and re-seal the darkness.
I want something which takes collaboration, coordination, and everyone's skills to do.
Like a real heist.

## A short tale from the desert.
Once, here, in this very place, was the greatest kingdom known to man.
In the Age of Heroes, the great palace of Aeschylon stood tall and mighty over a verdant grove.
Queen Hyperion united the realms of man under a banner as strong and storied as any before it, and brought a peace hitherto unknown.
"The Green Spring" it was called, and it was a century of peace for all.
It was a kingdom called Kyron, named for an ancient hero who united another land, centuries before even Aeschylon.

But as spring gives way to fall, and then to winter, the peace came to an end.
The days grew longer, and hotter. The crops dried and cracked in the fields of the broken men.
The nights were a bitter cold, and winds whipped chill through the stone bricks of Castle Aeschylon.

Within a decade, the lands were fallow.
The loyal knights of the Oath of Roses had dispersed to the winds, the great Masters of Nature had aged or died,
and even the great lorekeepers of Kyron were lost, or were slain, depending on which account you believe.

The grove of Kyron became the Desert of Ishtar, great conquerers from the West. They swept over the now-barren land.
Queen Hyperion was murdered in the Solar of her fine Aeschylon, and the palace was abandoned.
But the Ishtar gave way to the Kyroshi, then they to the Fiala.
The land and its meager resources were divided up, year by year, until nothing remained but sand and bones.

Now, these accursed sands are called by their truest name: The Vale of Dust.
The only creatures able to survive amidst the arid wastes are the hard, strange, and deadly types.
The only men left here are the dead or dying, or the remnants of the great tribes of The Everdry,
or perhaps - though it is mighty unlikely - the last of the Kyronna.

For there, in the gray wastes, under the three suns of Embry, the ruins of the great Palace of Aeschylon must still remain.
And though the desert's illusions might show falsehood to many a weary traveller,
I tell you, I saw the crest of a great spire of stone in The Vale!
When I was boy, yes, but I remember it as if it were yesterday.
Stones built by the hands of man, towers higher than any since has dared to build!
It was magnificent! In all these 70 years, I have never forgotten what I saw there.

So I tell you this - that Embry was once cruel to a sweet queen and her peace and her people.
Perhaps he still is cruel. I speak not for the Gods who watch over us.
But I think often on those days, on the bitter history of these lands - these lands which we now sit at the precipice of.
The lands which we gawk at.

And when I think on these disparate tales, and the strange mysteries of the Age of Sand, I wonder at the story we do not know.
Perhaps the story of a blood pact, and a terrible price exacted. Perhaps the story of the war between Gods and Men.
Perhaps a simple tale of nature exacting her toll.

But stories, like bones, are swallowed by the sands of time.
And no one knows what really happened to the Kyron, and to the Generous Queen Hyperion of Palace Aeschylon at the Twilight of the Green Spring.
